## Data Science

I have always enjoyed solving problems, and in that sense Data Science perfectly fulfills my curiosity. I'm always willing to take part to **Kaggle** competitions to discover new fields and learn from others.

After internships as a developper, I moved to a **Data Scientist** position at *Mention*.

## Tech

On a broader scale, I'm fond of all tech-related stuff. I like to learn new languages, program things, take a look at trending repos on **GitHub** and get to know the latest upcoming products.

## Hobbies

Apart from that, I like **traveling** and I follow world news really closely. I like watching all kind of sports, and movies and I am also a fan of various videogames.
